    <p class="subhead">Hi there!</p>
    I’m Caroline Omland, an avid backpacker, lover of the ukulele, and a VT fashion student. This past spring break, I traveled to the nation of the Haiti to work with an organization called feedONE and I would love to tell you about it!
    <br><br>
    Throughout that week, I experienced the HOPE of the Haitian people and learned the many ways feedONE was making an incredible impact in Haiti. 
    <br><br>
    Did you know that feedONE served over 19,179,753 meals last year in Haiti alone? Or that 1,850 farmers were trained? BUT, there are over 100,000 children left on a Waiting List, waiting to be fed. It’s only $10 to feed a child for an entire month. YOU can help reduce the Waiting List.
    <br><br>
    <p class="subhead">The Devastation of Undernutrition</p>
    It impairs both the mental and physical growth of children, slowing their cognitive development and perpetuating a cycle of poverty. Severe effects include: stunting, reduced adult income, decreased offspring birth weight, and an increased risk of death. 
    <br><br>
    <p class="subhead">Sustainable Impact -  It’s more than just a meal!</p>
    feedONE carefully monitors the impact of the meal on a child and provide essential vitamins and nutrient-rich food. Children enrolled in the feeding initiative receive regular, nutrious meals, clean drinking water, nutrition and hygiene education, and emotional and spiritual care. feedONE trains individuals to feed their families and communities and job trains and empowers women.
